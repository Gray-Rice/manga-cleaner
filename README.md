## ✨ What's New in v3.2.0

The evolution from v3.0.0 to v3.2.0 focuses heavily on giving you granular control over your masks and workflow:

*   **Expanded Toolkit:** We've added a **Polygonal Lasso** for precise geometric selections and a **Bucket Fill** tool that intelligently analyzes your mask layer. 
*   **Pro Canvas Controls:** Navigate like a pro. Zoom in/out with `Alt + Scroll`, pan the image smoothly, draw perfectly straight lines using `Shift + Click`, and dynamically resize your brush on the fly with `Alt + Right-Click Drag`.
*   **Transparency Scanning [T]:** Instantly detect and mask transparent/alpha areas with a single keystroke.
*   **Photopea Integration:** Don't have Photoshop? v3.2.0 introduces a seamless bridge to **Photopea** (the free web editor). Cleaned pages and originals are injected directly into your browser as layered documents.
*   **Linux Support:** The standard CPU edition now officially supports native execution on Linux environments!
*   **Smart Queue UI:** The file list now displays real-time status icons and padlocks, so you always know exactly which pages the background AI is actively processing.
*   **Mask Opacity Slider:** Dynamically adjust the visibility of your red mask overlay without altering the underlying data.

## 💎 Core Engine Features

*   **Resolution-Invariant Tiling:** Our Dynamic ROI Engine utilizes "Snap-to-8" reflection padding to process ultra-high 4K+ resolutions without downscaling. The output remains 1:1 perfectly sharp with no Gaussian blurring at the seams.
*   **Advanced AI Core:** High-frequency heatmap OCR for pinpoint text detection in Japanese, Korean, English and Chinese, paired with an ONNX-quantized LaMa core for ultra-fast, seamless inpainting.
*   **Hardware Optimized:** The GPU package provides real-time cleaning for NVIDIA devices (~900MB), while the Ultra-Lite CPU edition (~260MB) is perfectly pruned for laptops and integrated graphics.
